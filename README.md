# Explainable AI Intrusion Detection System (XAI-IDS)

This project implements an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages a powerful **hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model** for accurate anomaly detection in network traffic. What sets XAI-IDS apart is its integration of **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, providing clear and concise explanations for every detected threat.

**Key Enhancement:** **live network monitoring capabilities**, allowing the system to capture, analyze, and explain network traffic anomalies in **real-time**, making it suitable for proactive threat detection in dynamic network environments. It also addresses the challenges of class imbalance in network traffic datasets and the opacity of deep learning models.

**Developed by:** Sushminthiran S (211423104667)
**Guide:** Mr. Sasikumar A.N M.E.
**Institution:** Panimalar Engineering College

## Features

* **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model:** Utilizes a CNN-LSTM architecture for robust and accurate detection of network intrusions based on both spatial and temporal features.
* **Class Imbalance Handling:** Employs advanced techniques like SMOTE and Random Undersampling to improve the detection rates of rare attack types.
* **Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP:** Integrates SHAP to provide clear, feature-based explanations for why a specific network flow was classified as an attack, enhancing transparency and trust.
* **Streamlit Web Interface:** Provides an intuitive and interactive dashboard for both **offline simulation** and **live network monitoring**.
* **Live Network Monitoring (NEW!):**
    * **Real-time Packet Capture:** Sniffs live network traffic using `Scapy` on a selected network interface.
    * **On-the-fly Feature Extraction:** Processes raw packets into statistical flow features (mimicking CIC-IDS format).
    * **Real-time Inference:** Applies the trained deep learning model to live traffic for immediate threat detection.
    * **Dynamic Alerting:** Displays detected intrusions and suspicious activities in a continuously updating log.
    * **Live SHAP Explanations:** Generates and displays SHAP explanations for **real-time detected attacks**, providing instant insights into the attack's root causes.
    * **Configurable Packet Filters:** Apply Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) rules to selectively monitor specific traffic.
* **Persistent Alert Logging:** Automatically saves all detected alerts (including timestamp, attack type, confidence, and flow info) to a CSV file for post-analysis and auditing.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    cd Explainable_AI_IDS_Project
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):** `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):** `source .venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ```
    * **Scapy Permissions (Linux/macOS):** For live monitoring, `Scapy` requires elevated privileges to sniff network traffic. You might need to give your Python executable `cap_net_raw` and `cap_net_admin` capabilities.
        ```bash
        sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(eval readlink -f $(which python))
        ```
        (Note: This command needs to be run once per Python installation if using the system Python, or for your virtual environment's Python executable.)

5.  **Install Npcap (for Live Monitoring on Windows):**
    * Download and install [Npcap from npcap.com](https://npcap.com/).
    * **Important during Npcap installation:** Ensure the option "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode" is **CHECKED** for broader compatibility with `Scapy`. *Administrator privileges are required for Npcap installation.*

## How to Run

1.  **Activate the Virtual Environment** (if not already active).

2.  **Navigate to the `src` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    * The application will automatically open in your web browser.
    * Use the sidebar in the Streamlit UI to switch between "Offline Simulation" and "Live Monitoring".

4.  **For Live Monitoring (Crucial Steps):**
    * You **MUST** launch your terminal or command prompt with **Administrator privileges** (Windows) or use `sudo` (macOS/Linux) when running the `streamlit run app.py` command to allow `Scapy` to access network interfaces.
        * **Windows (Admin PowerShell/CMD):** Right-click on PowerShell/CMD icon -> "Run as administrator". Then `cd src` and `streamlit run app.py`.
        * **macOS/Linux:** `cd src` then `sudo streamlit run app.py` (you will be prompted for your password).
    * In the Streamlit sidebar, select your active network interface (e.g., `Wi-F1`, `eth0`, `en0`).
    * (Optional) Configure a BPF packet filter to monitor specific traffic.
    * Click the "ðŸŸ¢ Start Monitoring" button.
    * Observe the "Live Alert Log" for real-time detected threats and the "Live SHAP Explanations" section for insights into why an attack was flagged.
    * Click the "ðŸ”´ Stop Monitoring" button to halt the capture process.

## Notes

* The live monitoring feature uses Scapy and **critically requires elevated permissions (Administrator/root)** for proper network interface access.
* The SHAP explanation generation, especially the initial setup and for the first few explanations, can be computationally intensive and might introduce a slight delay.
* Ensure the file paths specified in `config.py` correctly point to your `data` and `saved_model` directories relative to where `app.py` is executed.
* The `app.py` directly embeds the `scapy_worker` logic using Python's `multiprocessing` module for efficient background packet sniffing.
